## Postman is a powerful GUI platform to make your API development faster and easier,through different functionalities:

* Make internal or third-party API requests
* Run tests to validate the behavior of our API
* Create different work environments with global and local variables
<br>
<br>
Our purpose is to automate an API process of multiple requests.
We will generate collections of requests to the APIs, then we can automate the execution
of all the requests and test it, which allows us to execute them in a simple and fast way.
<br>



Firstly we create a working environment and add the necessary variables for our
collection, these variables can be used for the header, url, body... we can click on the
settings button in the upper right corner to create and manage it.
Once the work environment has been created, we can begin to create our collection.
One of the advantages of Postman is that it allows us to configure the authentication, prerequest
scripts, tests ... all of them at the collection level, for which each of the requests
will inherit this configuration.

Once we have all the requests created, we can debug them by writing and running tests
for each request using the JavaScript language.

Finally our collection can be run using the collection runner, running a collection is useful
when you want to automate API testing. When you run a collection, you’re essentially
sending all requests in your collection one after another.
